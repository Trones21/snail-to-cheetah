### Phase 2.Parallelization – Concurrency
**Objective**: Introduce concurrency to improve throughput and scalability.

**Approach**:
- Experiment with OS threads (e.g., using C or Python) to understand their limits.
- Use Go routines to leverage Go’s lightweight concurrency model.

**Outcome**:
- Demonstrate the scalability and memory efficiency of Go routines.
- Highlight differences in execution time, resource usage, and ease of implementation.
