## Phase 4: Problem-Specific Optimizations
**Objective**: Address highly specific, real-world problems or edge cases.

**Approach**:
- Identify bottlenecks unique to specific workloads or file structures.
- Experiment with advanced techniques, such as:
  - Dynamic worker allocation based on file size or type.
  - Prioritization of tasks (e.g., processing certain files first).
  - System-level optimizations (e.g., pre-fetching data, caching).
- Analyze improvements at both **micro-scale** (e.g., reducing runtime from 300ms to 100ms) and **macro-scale** (e.g., handling millions of files efficiently).

**Outcome**:
- Showcase the depth of performance tuning for specialized scenarios.
- Provide insights into when such optimizations are worth the effort.
- Explore whether **unknown or unexplored time or space complexities** emerge at large scales.
